# ðŸ§ª Experiments - A Dumping ground of random code

`experiments` is a collection of small, self-contained code projects, snippets, and exercises. This repository serves as a playground for various types of work, loosely organized by topic like a digital notebook.

This is a living repository, meaning anything and everything here is subject to change.

- Code might be messy, experimental, or incomplete.
- Commit history may be casual or nonlinear.
- Some folders may evolve or disappear over time.
